        JavaScript's String type is used to represent textual data. It is a set of "elements" of 16-bit unsigned integer values. <br>
        Each element in the String occupies a position in the String. The first element is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on. <br>
        The length of a String is the number of elements in it.
